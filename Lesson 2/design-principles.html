<p>The design principle of alignment is when different elements of a page are aligned in relation to each other an another
    part of the page. This can occur both vertically and horizontally. The design principle of alignment is an important element 
    to consider in web design because it helps the content of a page to look neat and consistent making it easier to navigate and 
    read. A website that uses the design principle of alignment well is the Spotify mobile browsing site. </p>

<p>The design principle of white space is the practice of leaving space between type, images and any other compnents on a page 
    that make it easier for the viewer to comprehend what is being displayed. A webiste that demonstrates this principle well is 
    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This principle is used in the way that they leave a good amount of space between
    different posts and links on the home page clearly defining which post is which.

<h3>Repetition</h3>

<p>The design principle of visual repetition is defined as using the same or similar components throughout the design. This principle 
    brings unity and consistency to the page. A good example of repetition used in mobile browsing is  
    with the mobile site for Pepsi. Pepsi uses the design element of repetition by using their logo in multiple places 
    on the page. Using the logo like this helps with branding and to enhance their product to the viewer making it more 
    memorable and noticable to them.
