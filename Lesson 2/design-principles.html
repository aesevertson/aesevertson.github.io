<h3>Alignment</h3>
<h4>Spotify</h4>

<p>The design principle of alignment is when different elements of a page are aligned in relation to each other an another
    part of the page. This can occur both vertically and horizontally. The design principle of alignment is an important element 
    to consider in web design because it helps the content of a page to look neat and consistent making it easier to navigate and 
    read. A website that uses the design principle of alignment well is the Spotify mobile browsing site. The way in which this 
    principle is used well is that their front page has all of the text in the center of the screen making it easy 
    to follow along with. They also continue this same principle down below in the footer section of the website.  </p>

<h3>Hick's Law</h3>
<h4>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h4>

<p>The design principle of Hick's Law is the idea that when giving people more options to choose from on a website
    the longer it will take for them to make a selection. It is important when giving these options in a website to 
    provide enough choices bu not too many to where it is overwhelming to the visitor. A webiste that demonstrates 
    Hick's Law well is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They provide a handful options to select in their menu 
    tab but not too many to where it is hard to make a selection.

<h3>Repetition</h3>
<h4>Pepsi</h4>

<p>The design principle of visual repetition is defined as using the same or similar components throughout the design. This principle 
    brings unity and consistency to the page. A good example of repetition used in mobile browsing is  
    with the mobile site for Pepsi. Pepsi uses the design element of repetition by using their logo in multiple places 
    on the page. Using the logo like this helps with branding and to enhance their product to the viewer making it more 
    memorable and noticable to them.
